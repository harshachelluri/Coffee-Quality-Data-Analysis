# **Coffee Quality Data Analysis BY Power BI**

## **Overview**

The **Coffee Quality Institute (CQI)** is a non-profit organization committed to enhancing the quality and value of coffee globally. Established in 1996, CQI works with coffee growers, processors, roasters, and other stakeholders to improve coffee quality standards, promote sustainability, and support the growth of the specialty coffee industry.  

This project uses a comprehensive dataset provided by CQI to analyze key factors influencing coffee quality. By leveraging Power BI for data analysis and visualization, the project explores sensory attributes, defects, and processing methods to uncover insights and trends that impact coffee's overall quality and value.

## **Dataset Details**

The dataset includes rich information about coffee production, processing, sensory evaluation, and more:  

### **Sensory Attributes**  
- **Aroma**: Scent or fragrance of the coffee.  
- **Flavor**: Evaluates taste, including sweetness, bitterness, acidity, and other flavor notes.  
- **Aftertaste**: Lingering taste after swallowing the coffee.  
- **Acidity**: Brightness or liveliness of the coffee's taste.  
- **Body**: Thickness or viscosity of the coffee in the mouth.  
- **Balance**: Harmony between different flavor components.  
- **Uniformity**: Consistency of coffee quality from cup to cup.  
- **Clean Cup**: Absence of off-flavors such as sourness or mustiness.  
- **Sweetness**: Desirable quality that can be fruity, floral, or caramel-like.  

*Note: The **Total Cup Points** is the sum of these sensory attributes, representing the overall quality score.*  

### **Defects**  
- **Category One Defects**: Major issues like black beans, sour beans, insect damage, and fungus damage.  
- **Category Two Defects**: Subtle issues like over-fermentation, staleness, rancidness, and chemical tastes.  

### **Additional Variables**  
- Processing methods and regional origins.

## **Project Objectives**

This project focuses on addressing the following research questions:  

1. **Key Determinants**: What sensory attributes most significantly influence coffee quality?  
2. **Regional and Method Correlations**: Are there correlations between processing methods, origin regions, and coffee quality scores?  
3. **Defect Trends**: What trends or patterns exist in defect occurrences, and how do they impact overall quality?  
4. **Total Cup Points Analysis**: How do various factors interact to influence the Total Cup Points?
